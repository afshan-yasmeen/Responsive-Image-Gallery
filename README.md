Repository Name: responsive-image-gallery
Description:
A fully responsive and interactive image gallery developed as part of my Frontend Development Internship at CodeAlpha. This project demonstrates the creation of a dynamic image gallery with multiple features including image grid layout, carousel, and slideshow functionality. The website is designed to offer a smooth and visually engaging experience, optimized for various devices and screen sizes.

Features:
Responsive Image Grid Layout:
Displays a collection of images in a 3x3 grid. Each image opens a detailed view with its title and description when clicked. The grid layout adjusts seamlessly for different screen sizes.

Image Carousel:
Includes a carousel functionality with navigation buttons (next/previous) that allows users to browse through images. It also supports autoplay and swipe features for mobile devices.

Image Slideshow:
Users can activate a slideshow mode, where images automatically transition with a specified interval, providing an immersive viewing experience.

Navigation Bar:
A responsive navigation bar with links to the different gallery modes, including the image grid, carousel, and slideshow.

User-Friendly Design:
The gallery is built with a focus on enhancing the user experience, using modern UI/UX best practices, and ensuring easy navigation and engagement across desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used:
HTML for structuring the gallery pages.
CSS for responsive layouts and design aesthetics.
JavaScript for adding interactive features like the carousel, slideshow, and image navigation.
